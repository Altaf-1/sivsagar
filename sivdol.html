            dol (meaning the temple of the Lord Shiva) is a group of structures
            comprising three Hindu temples of Sivadol, Vishnudol (meaning temple
            of the Lord Vishnu) and Devidol (means temple of the Goddess Devi
            Durga in the local Assamese language) shrines, and a museum. These
            are located on the banks of the Sivasagar ("the ocean of the god
            Shiva") tank, also known as the Borpukhuri tank, in the heart of
            Sivasagar, in the Indian state of Assam. The tank was constructed
            between 1731 and 1738 and the temples were built in 1734 by Bar Raja
            Ambika, queen of Ahom king Swargadeo Siva Singha
            (1714–1744).[1][2][3][4][5] The height of the Sivadol (dol means
            temple in Assamese) is 104 feet (32 m) and the perimeter is 195 feet
            (59 m) at the base. It is crowned with an 8-foot (2.4 m) high
            golden-dome.The Sivadol or Shiva temple, built in the Shikhara
            architecture[7] (more specifically Ahom temple architecture), has a
            central tower which is said to be the tallest Shiva temple tower in
            India at a height of 104 feet (32 m).[1] The base of the temple
            measures 195 ft (59 m) in circumference.[1] The temple is built with
            stone and bricks. Inside the Garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), the
            Shiva Linga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) is deified, which is in a
            reverse setting. The Shikhara or Vimana (temple tower), which rises
            above the sanctum sanctorum, has a four-tiered, 8 feet (2.4 m)
            mastaka and is crowned by a kalasha made of gold. The tower itself
            is built with parallel ridges and furrows.

        The lower part of the tower is flanked by four smaller identical towers,
        which are known as the angashikaras. The garbagriha, where the main
        deity is deified in the form of a reversed Shiva linga, is
        interconnected with an antarala, a small antechamber, which has a roof
        known as do-chala, which is akin to a typical hut built in Assam. The
        antarala is also connected to one of the mandapas (outdoor halls). The
        exterior walls of the temple are embellished with sculptures and floral
        designs set in Bas-relief.[1] Some of the unique sculptures set on the
        outer walls of the temple are of the goddess Durga, which are seen
        carved with 2 arms, 4 arms, 6 arms, 10 arms and 16 arms.[8] The sixteen
        armed Durga holding various weapons is a "pan-Himalayan" theme adopted
        in plastic arts of Ahom temple architecture. Durga is depicted
        decimating Mahishasura, the demon king with a buffalo head, by thrusting
        a spear. She is riding a lion, her mount, which supports her in the
        fight with the demon.[9] This feature represents the harmonious blend of
        Brahminical Hindu culture with the Shaktism cult which the royalty of
        Ahom dynasty had adopted as their religious practice throughout their
        kingdom
