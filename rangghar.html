            Ghar is a two-storeyed building which once served as the royal
            sports-pavilion where Ahom kings and nobles were spectators at games
            like buffalo fights and other sports at Rupahi Pathar (pathar
            meaning "field" in Assamese) - particularly during the Rongali Bihu
            festival in the Ahom capital of Rangpur. It is three kilometres (1.9
            mi) away from the center of Sivasagar Town. Situated by the side of
            the Assam Trunk Road, it lies to the northeast of the Rangpur
            Palace, a seven-storied royal complex comprising the Talatal Ghar
            and the Kareng Ghar.

            Ranghar is said to be one of the oldest surviving amphitheaters in
            Asia, the building was first constructed during the reign of
            Swargadeo Rudra Singha with bamboo and wood. It was later rebuilt
            with brick by Swargadeo Pramatta Singha in 1744 - 1751 A.D.

            The roof of the Rang Ghar is shaped like an inverted
            royal Ahom long boat. The base of the monument has a series of
            arched entrances, while atop the roof sits a decorative pair of
            carved stone crocodiles. Many of the arched entrances have retained
            little more than their brick framework, with mere vestiges of
            sculptural adornments here and there. The Ahoms, who used special,
            thin, baked bricks, did not use cement but a paste of rice and eggs
            as mortar for their construction, a pulse called Maati Maah and a
            fish named Borali Mach in Assamese. They also made use of powdered
            mixed lime and bricks to cover the surface of the inner walls. It is
            said that this layer of powder used to keep the inside of the Rang
            Ghar cool. The adjoining field, known as Rupohi Pothar, wore a
            festive look when games like bull-fight, cock-fight, elephant fight,
            wrestling, etc., were held on different occasions during the Ahom
            rule. Rang Ghar, besides standing as the royal pavilion, also
            contributed in spreading the games to different parts of the kingdom
            and its neighbouring States. About a kilometer to the northeast of
            the Rang Ghar is the Joysagar Pukhuri. This is a man-made tank,
            encompassing an area of about 120 bighas of land. It was dug in
            memory of Joymoti Konwari, mother of Rudra Singha (1665 â€“ 1714) -
            the most illustrious of the Ahom kings.
