            King Rudra Singha had shifted his capital from Garhgaon to Rangpur
            in 1707 (then known as Tengabari). He started the construction of
            the Talatal Ghar, but it was initially built of semi-permanent
            materials. He especially brought an architect from Cooch Behar,
            Ghanashyam, whom he appointed as the chief architect and entrusted
            him with the duty of designing the new capital city of Rangpur.
            Later his successor king Rajeswar Singha constructed the Talatal
            Ghar with major additions in bricks. The upper floor which is
            currently exposed had earlier chambers made of wood, timber and
            other impermanent materials, which were burnt during the Moamaria
            rebellion, Burmese invasions and by British. The palace consisted of
            7 storeys, of which 4 storeys can be seen on the ground and the
            other 3 storeys which were underground were sealed and filled during
            the British era.

        The Talatal Ghar was initially built as an army base. It houses two
        secret tunnels, and three floors below ground level which were used as
        exit routes during the Ahom conflicts with other kingdoms or enemy
        attack (and which give the structure its name).[5] At present the palace
        appears to be a building with irregular shape. The ground storey was
        used as horse stables, store rooms and, servant quarters. The royal
        apartments were located in the upper floors which are now to a great
        extent disappeared due to being made of semi-permanent materials.Entrace
        of Kareng (Royal-Chamber) with few surviving floral relics on the top
        (Swargadeo Rajeswar Singha) added the three floors below ground, which
        make up the Talatal Ghar. This is made of brick and an indigenous type
        of cement (a mixture of Bora Chaul—a sticky variety of rice grain—eggs
        of swan, etc.). The Talatal Ghar had two secret tunnels. One, about 3
        kilometres (1.9 mi) in length, connected the Talatal Ghar to the Dikhow
        River, while the other, 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) long, led to the Garhgaon
        Palace, and was used as an escape route in case of an enemy attack.
