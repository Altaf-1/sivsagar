            Before the British period, the center of administration of Assam was
            around Sivasagar were the famous Ahoms ruled for nearly six hundred
            years. The Ahom kings took keen interest in building different
            temples, dedicated to various deities and which were usually flanked
            by large tanks which until today stand out as memorials to their
            glory in the district.[1] Sivasagar, or Rangpur as it was known
            then, was the capital of the Ahom Kingdom from 1699 to 1788. The
            famous Joysagar Tank was excavated within 45 days by Rudra Singha
            (1696-1714) in memory of his mother Joymoti Konwari. The Joy Dol is
            situated on the bank of the Joysagar Tank. Pramatta Singha
            (1744-1751) built the Ranghar with bricks in 1745. Gaurisagar Tank
            is situated at a distance of about eight miles from Sivasagar town.
            The Sivasagar Tank was excavated by queen Ambika Devi in 1733.

        The Siva Dol, Vishnu Dol and Devi Dol are situated on the bank of the
        Sivasagar Tank. Rajeshwar Singha (1751-1769) built the Kareng Ghar in
        Gargaon. Charaideo , about 28 kilometers away from Sivasagar is famous
        for a cluster of Maidams, the Ahom age tumuli. Sukapha, the first Ahom
        king , constructed his capital at Charaideo in 1253. Sivasagar was
        earlier known as Rangpur and Rangpur was earlier known as Metek a. The
        original name of Sivasagar district was Sibpur. On February 24, 1826,
        the treaty of Yandaboo consolidated the British occupation of Assam.
        This treaty of Yandaboo brought an end to the roughly six hundred year
        long Ahom rule in Assam. After the 1826 treaty, the British government
        in Assam incorporated a number of administrative changes such as the
        formation of districts. The Sivasagar district was created after the
        annexation of Purandar Singha’s dominion of upper Assam in 1839. The
        Sadar headquarter of Sivasagar was transferred to Jorhat in 1912–13. The
        undivided old Sivasagar district comprised three subdivisions , namely
        Sivasagar, Jorhat and Golaghat. In 1983, the Sivasagar district was
        reorganized to carve out the Jorhat district. It was further divided on
        15 August 1987 for the creation of the Golaghat district.
